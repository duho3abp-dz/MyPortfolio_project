## Project description

Since I did not like the portfolio site written in the course of the training, I decided to create a layout project that I personally liked. I wrote all the code myself. I used exclusively native JavaScript, without resorting to third-party ready-made solutions. I also split all JavaScript code into modules, which can be reused later.
